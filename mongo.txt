Mongo DB is the M in MERN stack

Traditonal SQL DB are built in  a relational structure. related tables reference each other using joins as data is queried. these relational talbes also normalise the data i.e data is not duplicated on the tables.
 
 DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) 

 NoSQL Like MongoDB do not favour D.R.Y. MongoDB stores data in DOCUMENTS. each record in the document are called COLLECTIONS. collections store data in key-value pair structure that look a lot like JSON.

 Advantages of MongoDB
1) performance: the speed at which a collection is queried is very fast
2) Flexibilty: it is very easy to make structural changes like having a new field without wrecking total havoc in your database. Just like adding a new property to an object
3) Scalabilty: it supports large DB with high request rates at a very low latency
4) Usability: it is very fast to get up an running in the cloud
